I now leverage my talent, experience and network to teach, coach and lead on Corporate Boards.

I became a Fortune Most Powerful Woman Entrepreneur by leveraging the fact that I was born a practical visionary. Since childhood, I wanted to become an entrepreneur, and once I learned that accounting was the language of business, I wanted fluency. Being a CPA gave me a strong practical skillset and the credibility to compliment my curious and visionary mind. Analytical decision making became second nature by understanding the foundational concepts of opportunity cost, return on investment and profitability.
 
Founding and building construction companies further allowed me to partner the analytical, methodical, process-driven side of my brain with the passion I‚Äôve always had for finding a way to live out my core values through adding stakeholder value to clients, supply chain vendors and employees.

Having spent most of my adult life as a mother of 6, caregiver to both parents and as an entrepreneur, I‚Äôve acquired considerable transferable wisdom that brings a unique perspective to executive decision-making.

As an entrepreneur, I‚Äôve developed a wide range of business acumen in every aspect of executive decision-making, while also building an expansive, powerful and diverse network. This kind of experience and perspective has allowed me to ask insightful questions and bring resourceful and innovative thinking to problem solving and strategic planning. 

I believe the most successful companies of the future will always focus on creating sustainable revenue models with healthy profits, but they will also be great employers, honest and fair supply chain partners, community champions AND environmental stewards. The goal is to strive for continuous improvement, measuring effective outcomes, transparency and even advocacy of stated corporate mission and core values.

The new lens for Corporate Governance requires diverse experience, more like a kaleidoscope than binoculars. The only appropriate response to the demand for innovative and bold leadership, is to recruit talent to the Board and top management that is willing to collaboratively commit to oversight of implementing the strategic plan, but also take a stand for moving the needle on working towards a balanced triple bottom line.",Venture Capital and Private Equity Principals,"Baltimore, Maryland, United States","Frederick, Maryland, United States",3 years 2 months in role,3 years 2 months in company,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQE1HQ5DwqIjYQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1655822828508?e=1695254400&v=beta&t=oSOWxebK9XG6JXqZSiecaYXUFtm20PDYW6GO4PO-h20,3,Theresa Daytner,ACwAAAAY9YQBq8q_bnRNDw_10z49i6IR2gD7RKQ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAAY9YQBq8q_bnRNDw_10z49i6IR2gD7RKQ/,true,false,"As a Lead Mentor for the Conscious Venture Lab, a startup accelerator aimed at accelerating conscious entrepreneurs to traction and revenue, I invest coaching and consulting resources, along with network connections, in purpose driven startups across the Globe.

Join our mastermind group to help you reach your goals. 

It is beyond ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù to have your name in an employment lawsuit. 

It is even more uncomfortable to find your name on the list as a subject or an individual defendant.  

I know, because it happened to me.

I am tired of being ashamed for what was 12 years between when I was contacted as a ‚Äúwitness‚Äù to an investigation to when I was vindicated on all charges by the Merit Systems Protection Board.   

Ashamed is feeling that we cannot speak of the unspeakable. To talk of the experience is to expunge that shame.  This is a selfish part of this action. The magnanimous part of talking about the experience is that I know this is something many federal executives are dealing with.  

As federal leaders, we do not have the freedom to discuss our case and are prohibited from disclosure of it ‚Äì which is completely understandable. We are permitted to talk about it is impacting us. The issues of the experience are under discussed.  

My goal is to put it out there and stop pretending that it‚Äôs not happening in the workplace; that it isn‚Äôt impacting us professionally, personally, physically, mentally, spiritually, and financially.  
The issues of leading while being named in a lawsuit or investigation are mental, physical, real, and impactful.  

Our mastermind group are federal executives who operate at a similar level, share similar values, and are looking to join a supportive community. Most importantly, all members have been named in an investigation or lawsuit and are seeking to grow and develop themselves personally and professionally.

Our members help each other reach their goals.  We engage in brainstorming, problem-solving, decision making, and sharing of ideas, solutions, and resources. A large part of each meeting is devoted to individual Hot Seats, where each member can share a challenge or question, and everyone helps the person in the Hot Seat by asking questions, listening, and providing knowledge, wisdom, and experiences. 

If you have been, or currently are a federal senior executive and named as a subject or defendant in an investigation or lawsuit ‚Äì let‚Äôs talk.

Let‚Äôs start with a 5-minute phone call. Contact me at any time at KC@CoffmanCoaching.com. 

I look forward to you joining our Mastermind group soon.

Best to you,

Thank you for taking the time to review my profile and assess the wide range of expertise I bring to the table. As my career history demonstrates, I‚Äôve earned a solid reputation as a results-driven Subject Matter Expert and Team Lead, skilled in technical, business case, and requirements analysis. I bring to the table an aptitude with strategic planning, project management, and administrative support and leadership skills.

I‚Äôve acquired significant success through leveraging a talent for driving accounting processes, overseeing program control, leading contract development and competitive negotiations, and performing financial forecasting. In addition, I possess the knowledge and abilities necessary for guiding integrated product teams (IPT), collecting and interpreting technical data, and creating breakthrough metric tracking tools. 

I‚Äôve repeatedly exceeded expectations in applying a robust history of orchestrating public relations, purchasing, talent recruitment, and quality assurance responsibilities, as well as a passion for devising and hosting high-impact staff training activities. 

These qualities have served me immensely well in assuming such far-reaching roles as an Management Analyst/Senior Specialist with Avantus Federal, Research Program Director for the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Management Analyst for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), and Program Assistant for the National Science Foundation.
