I now leverage my talent, experience and network to teach, coach and lead on Corporate Boards.

I became a Fortune Most Powerful Woman Entrepreneur by leveraging the fact that I was born a practical visionary. Since childhood, I wanted to become an entrepreneur, and once I learned that accounting was the language of business, I wanted fluency. Being a CPA gave me a strong practical skillset and the credibility to compliment my curious and visionary mind. Analytical decision making became second nature by understanding the foundational concepts of opportunity cost, return on investment and profitability.
 
Founding and building construction companies further allowed me to partner the analytical, methodical, process-driven side of my brain with the passion I‚Äôve always had for finding a way to live out my core values through adding stakeholder value to clients, supply chain vendors and employees.

Having spent most of my adult life as a mother of 6, caregiver to both parents and as an entrepreneur, I‚Äôve acquired considerable transferable wisdom that brings a unique perspective to executive decision-making.

As an entrepreneur, I‚Äôve developed a wide range of business acumen in every aspect of executive decision-making, while also building an expansive, powerful and diverse network. This kind of experience and perspective has allowed me to ask insightful questions and bring resourceful and innovative thinking to problem solving and strategic planning. 

I believe the most successful companies of the future will always focus on creating sustainable revenue models with healthy profits, but they will also be great employers, honest and fair supply chain partners, community champions AND environmental stewards. The goal is to strive for continuous improvement, measuring effective outcomes, transparency and even advocacy of stated corporate mission and core values.

The new lens for Corporate Governance requires diverse experience, more like a kaleidoscope than binoculars. The only appropriate response to the demand for innovative and bold leadership, is to recruit talent to the Board and top management that is willing to collaboratively commit to oversight of implementing the strategic plan, but also take a stand for moving the needle on working towards a balanced triple bottom line.","Fortune Most Powerful Woman Entrepreneur | Practical Visionary, Triple Bottom-Line Builder, Bringing 30 Years of Executive Range as CPA and Construction Executive | Certified Board Director","Frederick, Maryland, United States",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQE1HQ5DwqIjYQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1655822828508?e=1696464000&v=beta&t=hlhwPtv_YpHASWUY_BASsVJAD7TplatLwheCx88Fbuk,Theresa,Daytner,Theresa Daytner,1470,2nd,ACoAAAAY9YQBiV8NrMRSViK5INMpyg3DykoAbGM,1635716,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAAY9YQBiV8NrMRSViK5INMpyg3DykoAbGM,name",1443,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAAY9YQBiV8NrMRSViK5INMpyg3DykoAbGM%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAAY9YQBiV8NrMRSViK5INMpyg3DykoAbGM%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,"Julius Valentine Maina,  J.D., M.A., Lottie Byram, and 1 other mutual connection",Conscious Venture Lab,Lead Mentor | Angel Investor | Executive Coach | Strategic Planning | Impact Startup Champion ,"As a Lead Mentor for the Conscious Venture Lab, a startup accelerator aimed at accelerating conscious entrepreneurs to traction and revenue, I invest coaching and consulting resources, along with network connections, in purpose driven startups across the Globe.

Proficient, Respected, and sometimes feared Leader that understands the needs of the team, the activity, and the customer to be successful, while managing risk and removing / controlling all obstacles to this success (in any customer base, private, public, government, and military).  Add to this the use of defined processes and approaches, championed by governance bodies, to create an environment defining a path to success.

It is even more uncomfortable to find your name on the list as a subject or an individual defendant.  

I know, because it happened to me.

I am tired of being ashamed for what was 12 years between when I was contacted as a ‚Äúwitness‚Äù to an investigation to when I was vindicated on all charges by the Merit Systems Protection Board.   

Ashamed is feeling that we cannot speak of the unspeakable. To talk of the experience is to expunge that shame.  This is a selfish part of this action. The magnanimous part of talking about the experience is that I know this is something many federal executives are dealing with.  

As federal leaders, we do not have the freedom to discuss our case and are prohibited from disclosure of it ‚Äì which is completely understandable. We are permitted to talk about it is impacting us. The issues of the experience are under discussed.  

My goal is to put it out there and stop pretending that it‚Äôs not happening in the workplace; that it isn‚Äôt impacting us professionally, personally, physically, mentally, spiritually, and financially.  
The issues of leading while being named in a lawsuit or investigation are mental, physical, real, and impactful.  

Our mastermind group are federal executives who operate at a similar level, share similar values, and are looking to join a supportive community. Most importantly, all members have been named in an investigation or lawsuit and are seeking to grow and develop themselves personally and professionally.

Our members help each other reach their goals.  We engage in brainstorming, problem-solving, decision making, and sharing of ideas, solutions, and resources. A large part of each meeting is devoted to individual Hot Seats, where each member can share a challenge or question, and everyone helps the person in the Hot Seat by asking questions, listening, and providing knowledge, wisdom, and experiences. 

If you have been, or currently are a federal senior executive and named as a subject or defendant in an investigation or lawsuit ‚Äì let‚Äôs talk.

Let‚Äôs start with a 5-minute phone call. Contact me at any time at KC@CoffmanCoaching.com. 

I look forward to you joining our Mastermind group soon.

Best to you,
KC

As a teacher, my audience varied from English Language Learners and their families, to colleagues, administrators, and the community at large. I successfully tailored my communications to provide clarity to each target audience while keeping a consistent tone of professionalism and respect.
