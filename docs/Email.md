# Mailing lists

- all@ is the mailing list with everybody at the company
- We send notifications for commits and other services (e.g., Jenkins) to git@
- A GitHub user infra is used to check out code for services (e.g., Jenkins, ReviewBoard)

# Organizing email flow

- We receive tons of emails, and the inflow is going to keep increasing
  - At a large company you can get 10k emails per day (no kidding)
- The goal is to read all the emails and always be on top of it
- How can one do that?
  - As usual the answer is get organized
  - Filter emails in folders
  - Separate emails in folders based on the action that they require (e.g., ignore, just read and be aware of it, read and respond)
  - Read email and decide what to do about each of it:
    - No reply needed
    - Reply right away
    - Follow up later (e.g., to read, reply, think about it)
  - Use flags to distinguish what needs to be followed up later or if you are waiting for a response
- A possible organization in folders is:
  - GitHub
    - Commits in all the repos (be aware of it)
    - Issue updates (read and respond)
    - PRs
    - Commits directly to `master` (read and review)
    - Commits into `documents` dir of `master` (read and review)
    - Emails generated by my GH activities (ignore and mark as read)
  - Jenkins
    - Breaks
    - All-is-good
  - Gdocs changes

# Anatomy of email messages from infra

- The goal is to classify emails so that we can filter email effectively

## Filtering emails with Gmail

- Personally (GP) I prefer an email client (Mozilla Thunderbird and more recently Apple Mail) rather than using Gmail web interface
  - People are able to use it
- Personally I prefer to use filters on the Gmail (server) side
  - Pros
    - I don't get emails on my cell phone continuously
    - The emails are organized as they arrive
    - Folders are on the server side, so my client can simply sync
  - Cons
    - The Gmail interface for filtering emails is horrible
    - The web interface is [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters)
    - Note that Gmail distinguish different email accounts using different indices, e.g.,[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/<INDEX>/#inbox](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/<INDEX>/#inbox)

## Notifications from GitHub

- [https://help.github.com/en/categories/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github](https://help.github.com/en/categories/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github)

## GitHub pull requests

- These emails look like:
  ```

  Paul <notifications@github.com>
  Fri, Oct 11, 8:49 PM (22 hours ago)
  to
    alphamatic/amp (amp@noreply.github.com)
    Subscribed (subscribed@noreply.github.com)

  You can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:
   https://github.com/alphamatic/amp/pull/31

  Commit Summary
  PTask403: Add docstrings and type annotations
  Make comments self-consistent
  Add more docstrings, annotations
  ```

### How to filter

- These emails have review_requested@noreply.github.com in "to" field
- These emails have the words: "You can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:" in the body of the email

## GitHub issue activity

- These emails look like:
  ```

  GP Saggese <notifications@github.com>
  to
    .../... (...@noreply.github.com),
    me (...@gmail.com)
    Your (your_activity@noreply.github.com)
 
  A TOC (table of contents) for our md documentation might help navigating it,
  since it's not easy to have a view of the high level structure.

  A solution that seems pretty simple is here

- Another email looks like:
  ```

  Suject: \[.../...] BUG: jupytext sync doesn't work anymore (#572)
  To: .../... <...@noreply.github.com>
  Cc:
    Giacinto Paolo Saggese <abc@xyz.com>,
    Your activity <your_activity@noreply.github.com>

  > jupytext --sync --to py:percent

  ```

### How to filter

- These emails have different email addresses in the "to" field depending on the event that caused them:
  - `subscribed@noreply.github.com`: general GH bug activity (e.g., when the issue is opened)
  - `your_activity@noreply.github.com`: your GH bug activity
     - This is useful to recognize emails created by you and so automatically mark them as read
  - `comment@noreply.github.com`: comment on GH bug not from you
- These emails can be recognized by the fact that have the words "You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread." in the body

## Commits
