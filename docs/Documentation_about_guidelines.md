# Guidelines for describing workflows

- Make no assumptions on the user's knowledge
  - Nothing is obvious to somebody who doesn't know
- Add ways to verify if a described process worked
  - E.g., "do this and that, if this and that is correct should see this"
- Have a trouble-shooting procedure
  - One approach is to always start from scratch

# Useful reference

- [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [Google guide to Markdown](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/docguide/style.md)
  - TODO(gp): Make sure it's compatible with our linter

# Style and cosmetic lints

## Use nice 80 columns formatting for txt files

- Vim has a `:gq` command to reflow the comments
- There are plugins to take care of this for PyCharm
- Our linter takes care of reflowing the comments as well

## Empty line after heading

- Leave an empty line after a heading to make it more visible
  ```
  # Very important title
  - Not really important

  ## Coming through! I've big important things to do!
  - ... and his big important wheels got STUCK!
  ```

## Bullet lists

### Use bullet lists

- We like using bullet list since one can represent thought process more
  clearly, e.g.,
  - This is thought #1
    - This is related to thought #1
  - This is thought #2
    - Well, that was cool!
    - But this is even better

### Style for bullet lists

- We use `-` instead of `*`:
  - Bad
    ```
    * Foo bar!
    * hello
    * world
    * Baz
    ```
  - Good
    ```
    - Foo bar!
        - hello
        - world
    - Baz
    ```

## Using `code` style

- We use `code` style for
  - Code
  - Dirs (e.g.,` /home/users`)
  - Command lines (e.g., `git push`)
- When using a block of code use the write syntax highlighting
  - Bash
    ```bash
    `> git push`
    ```
  - Python
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        predict_the_future()
        print("done!")
     ```

## Indenting `code` style

- GitHub / pandoc seems to render incorrectly a code block unless it's indented
  over the previous line
  - Bad `> git push`
  - Good
    `> git push`

## Improve your written English

- Use English spell-checker
  - Unfortunately this is not enough
- Type somewhere where you can use several free choices:
  - [Grammarly](https://github.com/cryptokaizen/cmamp/blob/master/documentation/general/www.grammarly.com)
  - [LanguageTool](https://www.languagetool.org/)
  - Or other proofreading and copy-paste
- This is super-useful to improve your English since you see the error and the
  correction
  - Otherwise you will keep making the same mistakes forever

## Make sure your markdown looks good

- You can:
  - Check in a branch and use GitHub to render it
  - Use Pycharm to edit, which also renders it side-by-side

## Table of content (TOC)

### Markdown TOC

- Unfortunately both markdown and GitHub don't support automatically generating
  a TOC for a document
- Run linter in order to build TOC automatically
  - Detailed linter instructions at
    [First Review Process](First_review_process.md)
  - Currently linter does puts TOH above all the markdown text, so put a file
    name on top after the linter is run

### TOC tips

- Add the tags at the beginning of the markdown file
- Note that in the text below we interspersed spaces to avoid the TOC processor
  to add a table of content also here:
  ```
  &lt; ! - - t s - - >
  &lt; ! - - t e - - >
  ```

## Lint all markdown files

- To update all markdown files run:

  `> documentation/scripts/lint_md.sh`

# Google docs style conventions

## Headings

- We add N (where N is the heading level) `#` before the heading name, e.g.,
  - Heading 1:
    ```
    # Heading 1
    ```
  - Heading 2:
    ```
    ## Heading 2
    ```
- The reason is that sometimes one doesn't have the time or the patience to
  format things properly, so at least there is some indication of the level of
  the titles.
- Do not forget to convert the normal text to heading:
  - Select the text
  - Go to `Format`
  - Go to `Paragraph style`
  - Choose the heading style, e.g. `heading 2`

## Font

- Normal text:
  - Font: Arial
  - Font size: 11
- Headings:
  - Font: Arial
  - Style: bold
  - Font size: should be adjusted automatically when one converts “Normal text”
    to “Heading N”, e.g., when converting some text of size 11 to “Heading 1”
    the font sizes becomes 20

# Convert between Gdocs and Markdown

## Gdocs -> Markdown

- Approach 1:
  - Use the [Docs to Markdown](https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki)
    extension
    - Install
      [the extension](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607)
      from the G Suite marketplace
    - [User guide](https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki#using-docs-to-markdown)
      for the extension
  - One needs to accept/reject all suggestions in a gdoc as the extension works
    poorly when a document is edited in the suggestion mode
- Approach 2:
  - [https://mr0grog.github.io/google-docs-to-markdown/](https://mr0grog.github.io/google-docs-to-markdown/)
- Lint the markdown:
  - Replace all bullet points as `-` with `-`, if needed
  - Run the `linter.py`
    - Do not mix manual edits and linter runs
    - If the linter messes up the text
      - File bugs in `amp` with examples what the linter does incorrectly
  - When a gdoc becomes obsolete or it’s deleted
    - Add a note at the top of a gdoc explaining what happened
      - Example: "Moved to /new_markdown_file.md"
    - Strike out the entire document
    - Move the gdoc to the
      [\_OLD directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1J4B1vq8EwT-q_z7qSLCZ9Tug2CA9f8i7)

## Markdown -> Gdocs

- Approach 1:
  - `> pandoc MyFile.md -f markdown -t odt -s -o MyFile.odt`
  - Download the
    [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_OdO6f7VYjimgjfGPofsYHyWvyxXrtOVVcvCauJIpI/edit)
    in odt format
  - `> pandoc code_organization.md -f markdown -t odt -s -o code_org.odt --reference-doc /Users/saggese/Downloads/Gdoc\ -\ Template.odt`
  - Open it with TextEdit, copy-paste to Gdoc
- Approach 2:
  - Instead of copy-paste the markdown into Gdocs, you can copy the rendered
    markdown in a Gdoc
    - Gdocs does a good job of maintaining the formatting, levels of the
      headers, the links, and so on
- Approach 3:
  - [https://markdownlivepreview.com/](https://markdownlivepreview.com/)
  - TODO(gp): Check if the roundtrip works

## Markdown vs Google Docs

- Google Docs pros:
  - Easy to embed figures
  - Easy to collaborate
  - Easy to make quick changes (instead of making a commit)
  - Easy to publish (just make them public with proper permissions)
  - Styling
    - [https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/112275/define-special-inline-styles-in-google-docs](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/112275/define-special-inline-styles-in-google-docs)
- Interesting add-ons:
  - Enable Markdown
  - Code blocks
    - Use darcula, size 10
      ```
      def hello():
      print("hello")
      ```
  - Auto-latex equations
- Markdown pros:
  - Can use vim
  - Can version control
  - Easy to use verbatim (e.g., typing `foobar`)
  - Easy to style using pandoc
  - Easy to embed code
  - Easy to add Latex equations
- Rules of thumb:
  - If it has images -> gdocs
  - If it has mostly formulas -> md
  - If they are notes from book -> md
  - If it is a tutorial (especially with figures) -> gdocs
