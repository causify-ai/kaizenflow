# Sorrentum Dev Docker container (aka dev container, cmamp container)


# Getting a first issue to work on (aka warm-up issue)

- The goal is to get comfortable with the development system

- We mark certain bugs as "good-as-first-bug"

- Typical warm-up issues are:
  - Write unit tests
  - Copy-paste-modify (ideally refactor and then change) code
  - Simple refactoring
