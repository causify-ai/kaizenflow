# On-boarding Process

1. A candidate (intern or full-time candidate) submits a request

- The ResearchMeister gets the notification from the
  submission Gsheet and creates an Asana task under `Not started` with:
- Name (nickname) email
- E.g, Yuanxuan (Brandon) Fang &lt;yuanxuanfang@g.ucla.edu>
- Put the form links, the GitHub account, the LinkedIn / CV link, etc. in
  the Asana description (all the info that we typically need to access quickly)
- Google form: ?
- CV / LinkedIn: ?
- GitHub handle: ?
- Email: ?
- Telegram handle: ?
- Devops candidate: Yes / no
- Intern vs Full-time candidate: ?
- Quick review if the person is decent or not
- Assign to a shepherd
- If interns -> DanY / Samarth
- If full-time candidate -> shepherd based on \- \*
- If not clear ask GP

2. The shepherd reviews the CV to get a sense if they are decent or not

- It posts a quick summary of pros and cons
- We want to increase the quality of the collaborators, so if there is a red
  flag (e.g., no GitHub, low GPA, undergrad) we can decide to not on-board
- We can ask more people to take a look
- The goal is to avoid on-boarding people that will likely disappoint us

3. If the candidate is a no go, GP sends an email of rejection
4. The on-boarding shepherd is in charge of updating the Asana task with every
   interesting event
5. We start the on-boarding process as per

- Update the
  [Contributor List. ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eRZJaj5-1g6W7w_Ay4UhJEdtAvrTTM1V94cKj6_Vwoc/edit#gid=1253964093)Copy
  the information from

  as it is a master sheet for all the collaborators
- Ping GP on the asana task for that collaborator for invitation to the repo
- Add Contributor email as Commenter to the
  [Sorrentum - Contributors gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LXwKpmaFWJI-887IoA50sVC8-dw_1L8I)

6.  When the collaborator is ready to be on-boarded, file an issue like
    "On-board <FIRST NAME LAST NAME\> Aka &lt;GITHUB_HANDLE>". The content of
    the issue will be the following checklist. Admins need to keep track on the
