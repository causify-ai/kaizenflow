# Connecting Google Sheets to Pandas

- In order to load a Google sheet into a Pandas dataframe (or the other way
  around), you can use a library called `gspread-pandas`.
- Documentation for the package is
  [here](https://gspread-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)


## Installing gspread-pandas

- The library should be automatically installed in the Dev container
  - In a notebook
  ```
  notebook> import gspread; print(gspread.__version__)
  ```
  - In the dev container
  ```
  docker> python -c "import gspread; print(gspread.__version__)"
  5.10.0
  ```
- Otherwise you can install it in the notebook with
  ```
  !pip install gspread-pandas
  ```
- Or in the Docker container with:
  ```
  sudo /bin/bash -c "(source /venv/bin/activate; pip install gspread)"
  ```

## Configuring gspread-pandas

- Client credentials need to be generated by each user independently.
  - The instructions are provided
    [here](https://gspread-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#client-credentials).
  - The process is not complicated but it's not obvious since you need to click
    around in the GUI
  - The credentials file is a JSON downloaded from Google.
- `gspread-pandas` leverages `gspread`
  
- https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html
  
- Create a project using a name like "gp_gspread"
- Search for "Drive API" and click on Enable API
- Search for "Sheets API" and click on Enable API
- On top click on "+ Create Credentials" and select OAuth client ID
- Then you are going to get a pop up with "OAuth client created"
  - Click "Download JSON" at the bottom
  - The file downloaded is like "client_secret_42164...-00pdvmfnf3lrda....apps.googleusercontent.com"
- Move the file to `helpers/.google_credentials/client_secrets.json` (Overwrite the existing placeholder file).
  ```
  > mv ~/Downloads/client_secret_421642061916-00pdvmfnf3lrdasoh2ccsnqb5akr4v9f.apps.googleusercontent.com.json ~/src/sorrentum1/helpers/.google_credentials/client_secrets.json
  > chmod 600 ~/src/sorrentum1/helpers/.google_credentials/client_secrets.json
  ```

- Some gotchas:
  - Make sure to act only under your `...` account.
  - `project/product/application` names don't really matter. It's convenient to
    pick a name connected to the project so that it's easy to find later.
  - Whenever you are given a choice of making something generally accessible or
    accessible only to the members of your organization, choose making it
    accessible only to the members of your organization.
  - When you are given a choice of time periods to create something for, choose
    the longest one.
  - When you are given a choice between `OAuth client ID` and `Service account`,
    choose `OAuth client ID`.
  - Notice the "s" in the filename of Google credentials (`client_secrets.json`).

- To use the library on the server, the downloaded JSON with the credentials
  needs to be put into the server in `helpers/.google_credentials/` Upload your own JSON to overwrite anyone others if it already exists.
  

# Using gspread-pandas

- The notebook with the usage example is located at
  `amp/core/notebooks/gsheet_into_pandas_example.ipynb`.

- To use it:
  ```
  import gspread_pandas
  spread = gspread_pandas.Spread("Test")
  
  """
  Please visit this URL: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id=421642061916-00pdvmfnf3lrdasoh2ccsnqb5akr4v9f.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8182%2F&scope=openid+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fspreadsheets&state=RR4MskRhontWm2HRYGPtMt1ck4DpGL&access_type=offline
  """
  ```

- The first time the library is used, it will asks the user for an authorization
  code.

- After the authorization code is provided for the first time, it won't be asked
  again.

- The official use documentation is provided
  [here](https://gspread-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html).

- **Don't feel stupid if you need multiple iterations to get this stuff
  working**
  - Clicking on GUI is always a recipe for low productivity
  - Go command line and vim!
