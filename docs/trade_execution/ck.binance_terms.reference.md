## Spot trading

## Margin trading

* What is margin trading
- Trade assets using funds provided by a third party (e.g., Binance)
- Access larger sums of capital to leverage their position

* Isolated margin
- Margin is independent for each trading pair
  - E.g., open different accounts for different trading pairs
  - E.g., in BTC-USDT isolated margin market, you can only transfer, hold, borrow
    BTC and USDT

* Cross-margin mode
- Margin is shared across all positions
- Margin level is calculated according to the total asset value and debt in the
  account
- The system will:
  - check the margin level
  - notify you to:
    - add more margin
    - close a position
