# Kibot timing

- [gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdOj3DGpFzHQZ6dpYCMMAeyjTtqYgltyqDbQ7n8Vde8/edit#)

- Kibot documentation (from http://www.kibot.com/Support.aspx#data_format)
  states the following timing semantic:
  - "Aggregated data records have a time value indicating the time when the bar
    opened"
  - "For instance, a time stamp of 10:00 AM is for a period between 10:00:00 AM
    and 10:00:59 AM"
  - "All records with a time stamp between 9:30:00 AM and 3:59:59 PM represent
    the regular US stock market trading session."

- The implication of this is that Kibot intervals are `[a, b)` and they are
  labeled with `dt=a`

- Thus, the open price at time "ts" corresponds to the instantaneous price at
  time "ts"
  - By our convention this corresponds to the "end" of an interval in the form
    `[a, b)` interval
  - TODO(gp): Unclear?

- As a consequence, our usual `ret_0` (i.e., price entering instantaneously at
  time `t - 1` and exiting at time `t`) is implemented in terms of Kibot data
  as:

  ```text
    ret_0(t) = open(t) - open(t - 1)
  ```

  ```text
               datetime     open     high      low    close   vol      time  ret_0
  0 2009-09-27 18:00:00  1042.25  1043.25  1042.25  1043.00  1354  18:00:00    NaN
  1 2009-09-27 18:01:00  1043.25  1043.50  1042.75  1042.75   778  18:01:00   1.00
  ```

- E.g., `ret_0(18:01)` is the return realized entering (instantaneously) at
  18:00 and exiting at 18:01

- In reality, we need time to:
  - Compute the forecast
  - Enter the position
- We can't use open at time t - 1 since this would imply instantaneous forecast
- We can use data at time t - 2, which corresponds to [t-1, t-2), although still
  we would need to enter instantaneously
- A better assumption is to let 1 minute to enter in position, so:
  - Use data for [t - 2, t - 1) (which Kibot tags with t - 2)
  - Enter in position between [t - 1, t)
  - Capture the return realized between [t, t + 1]
- In other terms we need 1 extra delay (probably 2 would be even safer)
