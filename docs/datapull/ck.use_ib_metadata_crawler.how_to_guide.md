# InteractiveBrokers (IB) metadata crawler

- The InteractiveBrokers crawler allows downloading metadata about products that
  are available on the platform:
  - Global markets metadata (e.g., country, market name, products, operation
    hours)
  - Market products metadata (e.g., market, product, IB symbol, description,
    symbol, currency)

- The entrypoint of data extraction is
  https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1562

## Installation

- You can build an image in-place with `make`
  ```bash
  > make ib_metadata_crawler.docker_build
  ```

## Configuration

- Use `make` command for running

  ```bash
  > make ib_metadata_crawler.run
  ```

- The current work directory on the host will map into container folder
  `/outcome` that contains the crawler results:

  ```bash
  > docker run \
    --rm
    -v $(pwd)/outcome:/outcome \
    ib-crawler:1.0.0 \
    scrapy crawl ibroker
  ```

- The result of crawling is present in two `csv` files, with `tab` as a
  delimiter:

- `exchanges-timestamp.csv`

  ```csv
