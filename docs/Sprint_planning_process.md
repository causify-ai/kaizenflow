## Sprints

- Sprints are weekly, Monday - Friday and consist of the issues worked on during
  the week

- Sprints help us answer the questions

  - What did the team achieve last week?

  - What work is the team focused on this week?

- Anything worked on during a week is added to that week's sprint

- Issues added to a sprint but not worked on or completed during the week should
  not be removed (issues can belong to more than one sprint, and not removing
  helps measure how "overloaded" a sprint was)

- Each week's sprint has issues added to it before Monday's work begins (team
  leaders)

- Every issue in a sprint should have a point estimate

- The person working on the issue sets the point estimate

- To support adaptability and flexibility, issues may be added to a sprint
  mid-week (but issues should not be removed). While this may require
  sacrificing other issues in the sprint, the point is to make the trade-off
  apparent.

## Epics

- Epics are thematic groups of related issues

- Most epics are created around software components or user workflows (which may
  cross software components)

- Epics with a high level of activity are versioned and have a well-defined
  purpose

- It may take multiple sprints to complete all issues in an epic

- Epics help us answer the questions

  - What features is the team implementing?

  - What is the team's current focus?

- Keep the Epics alphabetized on the board
