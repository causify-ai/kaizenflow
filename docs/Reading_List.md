# Git

- [Short tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
- [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
  - To achieve mastery

# Bash / Linux

- [Short tutorial](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/lisa19_maheshwari.pdf)
- [Missing semester of CS](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

# Coding

- [The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery (2ed)](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Anniversary-Journey-Mastery/dp/B0833FBNHV)
  - Reading (and really internalizing) this book is equivalent to the experience
    you can gain by coding for 20 years
  - It will change your life

- [A Philosophy of Software Design (2ed)](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-2nd/dp/173210221X)

- [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction (2ed)](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670)
  - Likely the only decent product ever made by Micro$oft

- [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code)
  - Today the 12 steps are accepted as obvious, but in 2000 these simple ideas
    were revolutionary
  - (And yes Joel is holding the table tennis paddle incorrectly in the picture)

# Data analysis

- [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662)
  - Reading the book is not enough: you need to type and try _all_ the examples of the book
  - Remember:
    - Whatever you do, there is a more effective Pandas way to do it in one line
    - Any Pandas code using for-loop is provably sub-optimal
  

# SRE

- [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html)
  - An outstanding reference drawing on a wealth of experience at Google (but boring)
