# Python

- We will be using Python and Jupyter for all the research projects

- IPython Notebook / Jupyter is an enhanced command shell for Python, that offers
  enhanced introspection, rich media, tab completion, and history
- IPython Notebook started as a web browser-based interface to IPython and
  proved especially popular with data scientists
- A few years ago, the Notebook functionality was forked off as a separate project,
  called [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter provides support for many other
  languages in addition to Python

## Running Jupyter

- To start Jupyter do:
  ```
  > cd $GIT_ROOT/sorrentum_sandbox/altdata_examples
  > docker_jupyter.sh
  ++ git rev-parse --show-toplevel
  + GIT_ROOT=/Users/saggese/src/sorrentum1
  + REPO_NAME=sorrentum
  + IMAGE_NAME=jupyter
  + FULL_IMAGE_NAME=sorrentum/jupyter
  + docker image ls sorrentum/jupyter
  REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE
  + CONTAINER_NAME=jupyter
  + docker run --rm -ti --name jupyter -p 8888:8888 -v /Users/saggese/src/sorrentum1/sorrentum_sandbox:/data sorrentum/jupyter /data/devops/jupyter_docker/run_jupyter.sh

  ```

- This will start a Jupyter server in the container listening on port 8888
    - You will access it from the host (as discussed above, the Docker start command
      maps the 8888 port on the container to the 8888 port on the host)
    - To do that start the browser and point it to: http://127.0.0.1:8888

- Go with your local browser to `localhost:8888`

- Navigate to `/data` to see the directories mounted on Docker

- Read and execute the notebook

## Running bash

- Run container
  ```
  > docker_bash.sh
  ```
