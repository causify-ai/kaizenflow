# DATA605 Class Projects

- Each student picks one of the projects based on the complexity 1-3
  - Each student pick the complexity so that they kind self-select based on
    complexity
- One for the midterm and one for the final
- There is a sign-up sheet on Excel
  [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nwjIvXgEaxH_M21k8hYebVbFPLWh7UNglLUlh11psAs/edit#gid=0)
- We prefer students not to pick the same project

## Project assignment

- Each project requires the following steps

- Create a Docker container installing the needed tools (e.g., Redis and `redis-py`)
- You should use Docker Compose to build single or multi-container systems
- Jupyter notebook (if possible), otherwise a Python script implementing the project
- Only Python3 on Linux should be used
- You can always communicate with the tech using Python libraries or HTTP APIs

### Documentation
- Write a 5 to 10-page report in markdown covering:
  - At least 1 page (60 lines): short description of the technology used (e.g.,
    Redis)
  - At least 1 page (60 lines): describe and explain the logic of the Docker
    system that you have built
  - At least 1 page (60 lines): explain how to run the system by starting the
    container system
  - At least 3 pages (60 lines): describe the script/notebook with examples of
    the output, using diagrams (e.g., use `mermaid`), describe the schema used in
    the DB, etc

- The script/notebook should be able to run end-to-end without errors, otherwise
  the project is not considered working
  - We are not going to debug your code
  - If there are problems we will use the GitHub issue to communicate and we
    expect you to fix the problem

- Each project will need to be checked in https://github.com/sorrentum/sorrentum
  filing bugs, with PR, etc like in an open source project

- The tag of your projects follows the schema
  `Spring{year}_{project_title_without_spaces}`
- E.g., if the project title is "Redis cache to fetch user profiles", the name of
  `Spring2024_Redis_cache_to_fetch_user_profiles`

- Create a GitHub issue with the project tag (e.g.,
  `Spring2024_Redis_cache_to_fetch_user_profiles`) and assign the issue to
  yourself
  - We will use this issue to communicate

- Create a branch in Git named after your project (e.g.,
  `SorrTask645_Redis_cache_to_fetch_user_profiles`)
- You should add files only under the directory corresponding to your project
  `{GIT_ROOT}/sorrentum_sandbox/projects/{project_tag}`, e.g.,
  `{GIT_ROOT}/sorrentum_sandbox/projects/Spring2024_Redis_cache_to_fetch_user_profiles`
  - E.g., on the dir cloned on my laptop the dir is named
    `~/src/sorrentum1/sorrentum_sandbox/projects/SorrTask645_Redis_cache_to_fetch_user_profiles`

- Copy the files from the template to your project
  ```bash
  > cd $GIT_ROOT
  > git cp -r sorrentum_sandbox/projects/project_template sorrentum_sandbox/projects/{project_tag}
  ```

- The layout of each project should follow the examples
  - `sorrentum_sandbox/projects/spring2024/SorrTask645_Redis_cache_to_fetch_user_profiles`
