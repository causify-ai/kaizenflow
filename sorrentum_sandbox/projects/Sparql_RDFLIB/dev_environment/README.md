# RDF Metadata Analysis with RDFLib and Matplotlib

This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis on an RDF metadata file using RDFLib and Matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The RDF metadata file (dcatap.rdf) is used to extract and analyze various pieces of information using SPARQL queries. The results are visualized using Matplotlib.

### Project Structure

    dcatap.rdf: The RDF metadata file used for analysis.
    notebook.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading the RDF file, performing SPARQL queries, and plotting the results.
    README.md: This document.

### Requirements

    Python 3.6+
    Jupyter Notebook
    rdflib library
    matplotlib library

Installation

    Clone the repository or download the project files.
    Install the required libraries using pip:

bash

> pip install rdflib matplotlib




# Conclusion
