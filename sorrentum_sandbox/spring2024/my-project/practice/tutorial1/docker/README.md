## Technologies

### RabbitMQ: Messaging and Streaming Broker
- RabbitMQ is a flexible and scalable messaging system that supports various network protocols and manages the routing and distribution of messages effectively in large-scale systems. 
- RabbitMQ supports several open standard protocols. There are multiple client libraries available, which can be used with many programming languages.
- RabbitMQ provides many options that can be combined to define how messages go from the publisher to one or many consumers: routing, filtering, streaming, federation, and so on.
- With the ability to acknowledge message delivery and to replicate messages across a cluster, messages are safe with RabbitMQ.
