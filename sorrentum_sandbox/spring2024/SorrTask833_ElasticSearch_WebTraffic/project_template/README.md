# Title
## ElasticSearch to analyze web traffic
##
# The project focuses on utilizing Elasticsearch, Python, and Docker to create an analytical
# system for processing web server log data. Set up an Elasticsearch instance using Docker
# and developing Python scripts to generate synthetic log data resembling real server logs,
# ingest this data into Elasticsearch. Use a jupyter notebook to read data from the
# ElasticSearch engine. The aim is to extract insights such as traffic patterns, popular pages,
# and anomalies from the stored log data. Include basic visualization of the analyzed data
# using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly, thorough documentation detailing the project
# setup, code instructions, Elasticsearch queries, and a concise presentation summarizing the
# project&#39;s objectives, methods, and findings. It offers hands-on experience in Elasticsearch,
# Python programming, and Docker containerization while working on log data analysis.
