class TestOmsDbHelper(hunitest.TestCase):
    """
    This class allows to test code that interacts with DB.

    It creates / destroys a test DB during setup / teardown.

    A user can create a persistent local DB in the Docker container with:
    ```
    # Create an OMS DB inside Docker for local stage
    docker> (cd oms; sudo docker-compose \
        --file /app/oms/devops/compose/docker-compose.yml up \
        -d \
        oms_postgres_local)
    # or
    docker> invoke oms_docker_up
    ```
    and then the creation / destruction of the DB is skipped making the tests faster
    and allowing easier debugging.
    
    The invariant is that each test should:
    - (ideally) find a clean DB to work with
    - not assume that the DB is clean. If the DB is not clean, tests should clean it
      or work around it
      - E.g., if a test needs to write a table and the table is already present and
        partially filled, as a leftover from a previous test, the new test should delete
        it and then create it again
    - clean after themselves, i.e., undo the work that has been done
      - E.g., if a test creates a table, then it should delete it at the end of the test
